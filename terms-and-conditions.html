                <span class="these-terms-and">
                  You and Goldsainte agree that any dispute, claim or
                  controversy arising out of or relating to (i) these Terms or
                  the existence, breach, termination, enforcement,
                  interpretation or validity thereof, or (ii) your access to or
                  use of the Services at any time, whether before or after the
                  date you agreed to the Terms will be settled by binding
                  arbitration between you and Goldsainte, and not in a court of
                  law. The arbitration shall be administered by the American
                  Arbitration Association ("</span
                >
                <span class="last-updated-may">AAA</span>
                <span class="these-terms-and"
                  >") in accordance with the AAA’s Consumer Arbitration Rules
                  and the Supplementary Procedures for Consumer Related Disputes
                  (the "</span
                >
                <span class="last-updated-may">AAA Rules</span>

                  >") then in effect, except as modified by this Arbitration
                  Agreement. The parties agree that the arbitrator (“</span
                >
                <span class="last-updated-may">Arbitrator</span>
                <span class="these-terms-and"
                  >”), and not any federal, state, or local court or agency,
                  shall have exclusive authority to resolve any disputes
                  relating to the interpretation, applicability, enforceability
                  or formation of this Arbitration Agreement, including any
                  claim that all or any part of this Arbitration Agreement is
                  void or voidable. Notwithstanding any choice of law or other
                  provision in the Terms, the parties agree and acknowledge that
                  this Arbitration Agreement evidences a transaction involving
                  interstate commerce and that the Federal Arbitration Act,
                  (“</span
                >
                <span class="last-updated-may">FAA</span>
                <span class="these-terms-and"

                  proceedings pursuant thereto. It is the intent of the parties
                  that the FAA and AAA Rules shall preempt all state laws to the
                  fullest extent permitted by law. If the FAA and AAA Rules are
                  found to not apply to any issue that arises under this
                  Arbitration Agreement or the enforcement thereof, then that
                  issue shall be resolved under the laws of the state of
                  Delaware. The Arbitrator’s award shall be final, and judgment
                  may be entered upon it in any court having jurisdiction. In
                  the event that any legal or equitable action, proceeding or
                  arbitration arises out of or concerns these Terms, the
                  prevailing party shall be entitled to recover its costs and
                  reasonable attorney's fees. The parties agree to arbitrate all
                  disputes and claims in regard to these Terms or any disputes
                  arising as a result of these Terms, whether directly or
                  indirectly, including Tort claims that are a result of these
                  Terms. The entire dispute, including the scope and
                  enforceability of this arbitration provision shall be
